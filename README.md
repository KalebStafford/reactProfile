### Description
This is my react portfolio! I had to commit this in one go since previous repository got bugged and broke. The icons below are linked to my social media accounts. The works photos are linked to those challenge repos. All my contact information is included.  

### Installation
fork, clone, or download this repo as a zip. Make your way to the terminal and inside the Develop directory of the project, npm install. Once the node_modules are installed, run npm start.
